# Prediction-using-ML-algorithm

Over here, the dataset was given for Online Retail. And the problem statement is, 
-- User should be able to provide a Customer ID and Date, and program should be able to predict quantity.

# Approach 

1) Doing some exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
  - Find Missing values
  - Explore about the numerical variables
  - Explore about categorical variables
  - Finding relationship between features
2) Handling Missing Values
3) Treating Outliers
4) Modeling (Here used Decision Tree Classifier algorithm)
